<p>
This course will introduce the core concepts of operating systems, such
as processes and threads, scheduling, synchronization, memory management,
file systems, input and output device management and security. The course
will consist of assigned reading, weekly lectures, a midterm and final exam,
and a sequence of programming assignments. The goal of the readings and
lectures is to introduce the core concepts. The goal of the programming
assignments is to give students some exposure to operating system code.
Students are expected to read the assigned materials prior to each class,
and to participate in in-class discussions.

Prerequisites 
</font>
</td></tr><tr>
<td>
Students should have previous familiarity with programming in a high-level
object-oriented language (such as C++ or Java); assembly language programming;
CPU organization, instruction sets, registers; program development in the
Unix environment (edit, compile, link, load, execute, makefile, using the
shell); the Unix system call interface; basic data structures (lists, trees,
graphs); object-oriented concepts (class, object, method). CS 200 and
CS 201 (Computer Systems Programming I &amp; II) are prerequisites for this
class. CS 311 (Computational Structures) is also listed as a prerequisite,
but the material in 311 is not as closely related to this class.

BLITZ
</a>
system.
BLITZ
is a collection of software, written by
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170906055517/http://www.cs.pdx.edu/~harry">
Harry Porter,
</a>
designed to
streamline the process
of learning about, and experimenting with, operating system kernel
code.
BLITZ
includes a complete operating system, assembler, linker, loader
and debugger, together with software to emulate an underlying CPU
and various devices. The emulated CPU and devices are representative
of real-world systems, but without some of the low-level complexity
that complicates the process of learning about the key underlying
concepts. By using BLITZ students are able to study, in detail, the
low-level operating system code that interacts with the hardware,
as well as design, code and test their own modifications to the
operating system.
